undid - Estimate difference-in-differences with unpoolable data. {p_end}

{title:Command Description}  

{phang}
{cmd:undid_stage_three} Takes in all of the filled diff df CSV files and uses them to compute group level ATTs as well as the aggregate ATT and its standard errors and p-values.

Required parameters:

- {bf:dir_path} : A string specifying the filepath to the folder where all of the filled diff CSV files for this analysis are stored.

Optional parameters:

- {bf:agg} : A string which specifies the aggregation methodology for computing the aggregate ATT. Options are:
    -> "silo", "g", "gt", "sgt", "time", or "none". Defaults to "g".

- {bf:weights} : A string, determines which of the weighting methodologies should be used. Options are:
    -> "none", "diff", "att", or "both". Defaults to the weighting methodology specified in the filled diff CSV files.

- {bf:covariates} : Integer, either 1 (true) or 0 (false), which specifies whether to use the `diff_estimate` column or the `diff_estimate_covariates` column from the filled diff df CSV files when computing ATTs.
  Setting to 1 (true) selects the `diff_estimate_covariates` column and 0 (false) selects the `diff_estimate` column. Defaults to 0 (false).

- {bf:use_pre_controls} : Integer, either 1 (true) or 0 (false), which declares if the not-yet-treated differences from treated silos should be used as controls when computing relevant sub-aggregate ATTs.
  Defaults to 0.

- {bf:nperm} : An integer specifying the number of unique random permutations to consider when performing the randomization inference. Defaults to 1000. 

- {bf:verbose} : An integer value that controls progress reporting frequency during the randomization inference procedure. When set to a positive integer N, progress updates will be displayed every N permutations.
  Setting to 0 disables the progress messages. Defaults to 0.

- {bf:seed} : An integer value, the seed used for randomization inference.

- {bf:max_attempts} : An integer, sets the maximum number of attempts to find a new unique random permutations during the randomization inference procedure. Defaults to 100.

- {bf:check_anon_size} : An integer, either 0 (false) or 1 (true), which if toggled on, displays which silos enabled the 'anonymize_weights' argument in stage two, and the respective 'anonymize_size' values.
  Defaults to 0.
